YOUR STORY:

I Built This Because I Needed It

Three months ago, I couldn't focus for more than 20 minutes. I'd start coding projects and abandon them. I'd plan my day and never follow through.

Then I discovered Deep Work principles and adapted them for ADHD. 

Result? I deployed 4 websites in 2 days. I'm learning JavaScript. I'm building an online business.

This planner is the exact system I use daily. If it works for my chaotic ADHD brain, it'll work for yours.
